## Explanation

It has been more than two weeks since my last post, and that may seem pretty confusing based on how I was so habit focused. My family and I went on an impromptu trip for a week and that made keeping up my routine hard. Now I am finally starting to get back into the groove of things after being home for a week. My music and leetcode challenges have seen their end, but I am glad to share that I have continued to make progress on the game during this time. 

## The Game

We recently released a "spoiler" like video for it:

The person I have been working with has been especially rocking with art progress:

While the original plan was to spend a full 30 days making lots of bosses and as much content as we could, I am starting to realize that I coded with a lot of bad practices and that is making it hard to add all the features I would like without having to rewrite a lot of stuff I already did. This means that we will try to take what we have and polish it into a short but complete experience before we move onto our next game.

## Lessons

Making this game has been such an educational experience. The knowledge I gained will be extremely useful for future projects. Perhaps the skill I am most excited about cultivating is the ability to estimate the amount and quality of work I can accomplish in a set amount of time. Being able to predict and set expectations realistically for future projects is extremely important and will allow for better planning of future projects.

## The Challenge

While I have been working my way back into my routine, there is one more challenge I have to get through. This semester I have done a healthy amount of procastination and next is week is finals week. That means that I cannot focus on the things I would like to as much as I can, but I am going to try to fit in progress when I can. Next week I will have finished finals and can really get back into the groove of things!
