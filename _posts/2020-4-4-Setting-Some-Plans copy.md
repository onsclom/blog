title: Setting Some Plans

## Free Time

Right now is a major opportunity. With current events, people have gained much more free time through the cancellation of jobs, schools, and activities. It is crucial to recognize that when free time rises, the potential outcomes for one's self grow more extreme. On the negative side, a lack of structure in daily activities can cause one's thoughts to lose stucture. Nihilism almost becomes the normative response when the patterns of one's life, which serve as foundations for their values, completely dissapear. However, there is an equally strong positive side. If one takes care to replace their old structures with structures that are more solid, they could form an even stronger foundation than what they previously had. They could live a more purposeful life where the things they do and believe in have more value. These two paths build momentum and lead very different directions. 

Because of this, I am choosing to put some structure in how I plan to spend my time. In the rest of this post I will brainstorm some general goals, dissect that brainstorming for more specificity, and lastly, develop plans to achieve those goals.

## Brainstorming

As for brainstorming, I think it will be best to simply list some general goals I have in no specific order:

+ Health
  - Improve strength and flexibility
  - Improve cognitive functionality
  - Improve aesthetics
+ Financial
  - Be financially independent
  - Make money doing things I enjoy
+ Other
  - Contribute to a project that people actually use
  - Continue music and other creative pursuits
  - Become a better writer

## Dissection

Health is rightfully at the top because health will provide me with energy to accomplish the things below. Things like eating healthy, working out, yoga, and meditating will be great for that. Financially, I must do some work marketing myself. While I really like the idea of freelance work, I could also see myself enjoying the right 9-5 job. There is no reason I cannot aim for both of these simultaneously as they would even help eachother. Projects and skills will translate from one to the other. 

Contributing to a project that people actually use is something I have been especially craving lately. These past few days I have been really inspired by the work of Ryan Kirkbride in making FoxDot, a python environment for live coding music. It is such a creative project and he really went through great lengths to make sure it is accessable with tutorials and documentation in many different mediums. While it does not have the largest community, it has a small but very passionate community, and I find that just as interesting. I hope one day soon to contribute to a great project like this or even start one up of my own.

## Conclusion

While originally I was going to conclude with specific plans for how I will tackle the above goals, writing this up took me longer than expected, and I now have a new idea. I will let these thoughts simmer in my mind and dedicate next week's post to the specifics of my planning. I cannot imagine anyone will actually read through all this, but if so, I hope it was interesting and gave you insights to your own life.
