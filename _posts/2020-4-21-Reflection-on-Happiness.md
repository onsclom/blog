title: Reflection on Happiness
---

## Introduction

I would say I have always been happy, but these last few days have been especially great. While it is normal for me to spend a somewhat sizeable portion of my day aimlessly searching for a dopamine rush on sites like youtube or reddit, lately I have been living a much more purposeful life where that time has been replaced with focused and creative "work" sessions. This post will be an attempt to reflect on what I have been doing right and dissecting why it has been working.

## Reflection

Firstly, I should probably reflect on the previous blog post. Last week I made it my goal to build and follow a more regimented body weight routine. Believe it or not, I actually failed this goal. My routine has remained pretty much the same with me normally just doing one or two different excercises unlike what I hoped (atleast a few excercises a day crafted with some more research and structure). This is especially interesting, because it proves that I have already built up so much value from my previous goals that I can fail a goal here and there and still be happy. 

So let us the reflect on the things I have been doing recently that have been giving me so much value:
* I am now 21 days into the 30-Day leetcode challenge. I remember before going to bed last night my tired brain thinking "OH CRAP I FORGOT MY LEETCODE PROBLEM TODAY! NOOO MY STREAK" and being super upset... and then I remembered I did it first thing in that morning like all the previous 20 days. I think that this shows that this small little challenge of a problem a day is something I have became really invested in. I am always excited to see the new problem and it is great spending 30 mins to an hour problem solving these.
* My senior project rhythym game is coming to its end. It has been really fun implementing the editor functionality this past week. Collaborating with such a big team has been really fun and rewarding.
* I am 11 days into my [30-Day music challenge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9E4NyfFZzQ&list=PLv7Gn4qudqgh2nMTO9xVsG3JzNhIehfaA). Even though I feel like some days my songs have not even been that great, every once in a while I make something that really interests me. It is crazy to think that I already am a third of the way through and already have 10 minutes of new songs.
* A few days ago I made my first pull request to an open source project. It was a small and easy bug fix, but it felt great to actually be able to understand the source code, navigate it, and make a contribution to something people actually use.
* I have started a game project with a friend a day ago and am already hooked on the development process. While it is still in the very early stages, it is clear that it has more potential than any game I have made prior.

## Conclusion

It is so easy to resort to youtube or reddit for hits of dopamine while ignoring the things that may take more effort but are more rewarding. The thing that has shocked me is that once you put in the effort to start a habit, it becomes so easy to continue that habit. I actually cannot imagine quitting this 30 day leetcode challenge or music challenge now, and when they are done I will probably have to replace them with something new. I have learned thoughts of "I should do X" being followed by mindless consumption can be really toxic. Once we rid ourself of that vicious cycle I think we live a much more purposeful and enjoyable life.
