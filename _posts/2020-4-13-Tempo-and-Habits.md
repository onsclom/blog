## Adaptable Challenge

The reason one fails to make lifestyle changes is because on does not adapt the challenge. Two things often happen; taking on too much of a change will result in stress and taking on too little results in apathy. It is crucial to find the suitable challenge based on one's own discipline level. This idea was coined by Mihaly Csikzentmihalyi as "flow".

## Using Flow

In applying this to my life, I must make sure that the changes I incorporate are suited for my discipline level. As someone who has never been very disciplined, it is easy to overload myself with structure and goals which never see fruition. While I often become impatient with my progress, I am starting to see the power of slow consistant progress. Less than a year ago I was not able to do a single pullup, but I started slow and consistant training. While most improvements in my life come from a sudden "Aha" moment, this was different. Each day I never felt like I was really improving and some days I actually would do worse than the day before. But now I can look back and realize that I went from being able to do 0 pullups to now being able to do multiple sets of 10.

I have been really enjoying two challenges I have been doing recently. Firstly, I am two weeks into leetcode's 30-day challenge. It has been really fun waking up each morning and wondering what problem I was assigned. Secondly, I am 3 days into a music goal I set for myself. I want to go 30 days straight of making a lofi song that is roughly a minute long. The goal being that I will have a 30 minute playlist of my own music to study to and share with others. It feels really great to be creative and produce something everyday, even if it is only a small minute long song. I think these two challenges have been so fun because they correspond so well to my level of discipline.

## Finally, Plans

With all the meditation on flow from above, I think it becomes clear how to proceed forward. I need to give myself goals which would be a good fit for my level of discipline. I need to expect that my estimations will never be perfect and that if I find myself having a hard time sticking to my plans, it is probably because I need to adapt the difficulty of what I have assigned myself. 

I have decided that assigning myself a new habit every week is good as a first estimate. Following the logic of my last post, I want my first "new" habit to be a consistant workout plan. While I used to workout way more when I had access to my school's gym, I have yet to really put in the effort to make myself replacement bodyweight routine. So the official goal: alternate pull, push, and legs per day and try to aim for 3 workouts each. Next week Sunday-ish I will check back in, assess how I did, and probably assign myself another habit :^)
