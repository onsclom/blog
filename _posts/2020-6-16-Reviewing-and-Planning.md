## The last month

It has been a month since my last post. In that time I have gotten better at using Godot, participated in two game jams, started the onboarding process for a developer job, improved with my fitness regimen, started an online summer class, and I have gotten back into chess. All of this is exciting and I am improving how I use my time, but I feel like in this past week my priorities have become unclear. This goal of this blog post is to review how I have spent this first half of summer and solidify my goals and priorities for going forward.

## Game dev and chess

Participating in the game jams was amazing and it felt like I was spending my time in the most purposeful way possible. It is an amazing feeling coming up with creative ideas, implementing those ideas ideas, and ultimately seeing the creations be played and enjoyed by others. However after these game jams, the subjectiveness and nonlinear nature of game development left me burned out and opened the door for an old interest of mine to come back, chess. 

I have been spending a lot of time playing chess this last week or two and it has had its pros and cons. Chess really filled a hole that game development brings which is objective judgement. When you play online chess, you get an elo score and as you play you get objective measurements on how much you are improving by. Unlike game development, the rules are simple and the difference between winning and losing is clear and objective.

Since I enjoyed this regained sense of order, I have shifted my focus to chess and pushed game dev to the side this last week. While I have enjoyed this break with chess, I do not think this is the most optimal way to continue long term. I recieve a much greater sense of purpose working with game development, and I believe that I will be happier in the future if I continue progress with game dev rather than focusing primarily on chess.

## Plan for going forward

In the remaining part of this post I will make myself daily guidelines. Everything on these guidelines will be things I enjoy doing in the present moment AND they will combine in such a way that I will be happy with my progress after following them.

+ Game Dev: > 3 hours per day. (listed are ideas for ways to spend that time)
  - The Book of Shaders
  - 3D 
  - Lighting
  - Experimenting with prototypes
  - Start a project?
  - Godot documentation
+ Chess: 2-3 hours per day (listed are exactly how to spend this time every day)
  - 2 10+0 games and analyze them after
  - 1 hour of puzzles and/or puzzle rush
  - 1 hour of lessons
+ Summer school: 1 hour
  - No procastinating lol
+ Fitness: 
  - Usual exercises
  - Yoga
  - Take breaks from sitting at computer for long periods

This schedule should get me in the habit of ensuring I spend my time doing things I enjoy both in the short and long term. I think I should give this a fair shot for a week or so, then I could adapt it based on how things went. I am excited to see how this goes and I will report back soon.
